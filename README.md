# Image Colorization using U-Net + VGG16 Encoder (TensorFlow)

This project implements a **deep learning–based automatic image colorization model**, which takes **grayscale images** as input and predicts the corresponding **color channels (a,b in Lab space)** using a **U-Net decoder** with a **pre-trained VGG16 encoder** as the feature extractor.

## Features
- Converts grayscale images (L channel) to color (a,b) using deep learning  
- Uses **VGG16 (ImageNet)** as a frozen encoder to leverage pre-trained semantic features  
- Decoder follows a U-Net–style structure with skip connections for better spatial detail  
- Includes TensorFlow data pipelines for efficient preprocessing & batching  
- Live visualization callback to preview colorized outputs after each epoch

## Model Architecture
- **Encoder:** Pre-trained VGG16 (ImageNet), frozen weights  
- **Bottleneck:** Deep semantic features (16×16 resolution)  
- **Decoder:** U-Net style with Conv2DTranspose + skip connections to reconstruct (a,b)  
- **Loss:** MSE between predicted and ground-truth (a,b) channels  
- **Input:** L channel `(256×256×1)`  
- **Output:** ab channels `(256×256×2)`

## **Part 2 — CV Key Points (Short, Crisp Bullet Style)**

You can put these under your **Projects** or **Deep Learning** section of your CV:

- Developed an **automatic image colorization model** using **TensorFlow** with a **U-Net decoder** and **VGG16 encoder** for grayscale-to-RGB conversion.  
- Implemented a **custom preprocessing pipeline** (OpenCV + tf.data) for converting RGB → Lab color space and efficient batching.  
- Integrated **pre-trained VGG16** as a feature extractor to improve semantic colorization performance.  
- Added **live visualization callbacks** during training to monitor model outputs.  
- Optimized model for **hardware constraints** by adjusting input resolution and batch size.
 
- Designed modular code structure (`preprocess.py`, `train.py`, `utils.py`) to enable future integration with GAN-based loss functions.  
- Documented and published the full project on **GitHub**, making it reproducible and easy to extend.
